HINTS
-----------------
This is the implementation of our paper "[HINTS: Citation Time Series Prediction for New Publications via Dynamic Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/papers/2021_WWW_HINTS.pdf)", published in WWW'21.

Data
-----------------

The original data used could be access from [Aminer](https://www.aminer.org/citation)  and [APS](https://journals.aps.org/datasets).

We also provide our processed data [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zqj1r4icwophb3a/AAANshyUt-f5yT6w-9ri-WK-a?dl=0) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cX2qh3Bq_GCnYQUiMVa33mExK4RWDwKY?usp=sharing) to reproduce the results reported in our paper. 


Requirement
----------------------
All required packages could be found in `requirements.txt` (generated by `pip freeze`).

NOTE: our implementation is on Tensorflow 1.14, may not be very friendly if you are familar with dynamic computational graph based frameworks.



How to run?
----------------------

* Step0 (data): 
	* Download the [processed data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zqj1r4icwophb3a/AAANshyUt-f5yT6w-9ri-WK-a?dl=0) and `unzip *.zip` under the root folder.

* Step1 (run):
	* `cd ./src`
	* For Aminer dataset: `python main.py --dataset aminer --epochs 700 --batch_size 3000`
	* For APS dataset: `python main.py --dataset aps --epochs 500 --batch_size 1200`

Arguments interpretation:

- `--dataset`: processed dataset, either AMiner or APS. 

- `--epochs`: number of training on the training set.

- `--batch_size` : batch size of one training.


Note that the batch size in set as the number of papers used in training, i.e., there is only one interation per epoch. I didn't try "mini-batch"-like training.


The prediction files will be stored under the `result` folder.
